Displays information about Amazon's Free App of The Day for Android



FAOTD (Free App of The Day) is a program I made for a friend (who is an Amazon fan).
It gets and displays infomation about Amazon's "Free App of The Day" for Android.


It is written in Python/QT (Python3, PySide).


Biniaries/installers are available at: http://danieltd.github.io/faotd



This is one of my first programs (that aren't just small CLI scripts).


Thanks to programs/services that made this program possible:
 - Geany (IDE)
 - Python (programming language, that makes programming possible for the simpleminded)
 - QT (cross-platform GUI toolkit)
 - GitHub (this website ;) )
 - Google (finds answers to my questions)
